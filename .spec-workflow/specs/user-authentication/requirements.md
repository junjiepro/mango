# User Authentication System - Requirements

## Overview

This document outlines the requirements for implementing a secure and user-friendly authentication system using Supabase as the backend service. The system will provide essential authentication features including user registration, login, password reset, and account management.

## User Stories

### 1. User Registration

**As a** new user
**I want to** create an account using my email and password
**So that** I can access protected features of the application

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] User can enter email and password to register
- [ ] Password must meet complexity requirements (min 8 chars, special chars, numbers)
- [ ] Email verification is required before first login
- [ ] Success message is displayed after registration
- [ ] Verification email is sent to the provided email address

### 2. User Login

**As a** registered user
**I want to** log in with my email and password
**So that** I can access my account

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] User can log in with email and password
- [ ] Failed login attempts are limited and logged
- [ ] Session is maintained across page refreshes
- [ ] User is redirected to the dashboard after successful login
- [ ] Error messages are clear and helpful

### 3. Password Reset

**As a** user who forgot their password
**I want to** reset my password
**So that** I can regain access to my account

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] User can request a password reset via email
- [ ] Reset link expires after 24 hours
- [ ] User can set a new password after verification
- [ ] Email notification is sent when password is successfully changed

### 4. Profile Management

**As a** logged-in user
**I want to** update my profile information and password
**So that** I can keep my account details current

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] User can view and update their profile information
- [ ] User can change their password with current password verification
- [ ] Changes are saved and reflected immediately
- [ ] Email verification is required for email address changes

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Security

- [ ] All passwords are hashed before storage
- [ ] HTTPS is enforced for all authentication endpoints
- [ ] CSRF protection is implemented
- [ ] Rate limiting is applied to authentication endpoints
- [ ] Use Supabase's built-in session management

### Performance

- [ ] Authentication requests should complete within 2 seconds
- [ ] The system should handle up to 1000 concurrent users

### Usability

- [ ] Clear error messages for common authentication failures
- [ ] Loading states during authentication processes
- [ ] Responsive design for all screen sizes

## Technical Constraints

- Backend: Supabase Auth (leveraging built-in authentication features)
- Frontend: Next.js with TypeScript
- Session Management: Supabase's built-in session management with JWT

## Implementation Notes

- Will use Supabase's built-in authentication methods for all auth flows
- Password complexity will follow Supabase's default requirements
- Session management will be handled by Supabase's client library
